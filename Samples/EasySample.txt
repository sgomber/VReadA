Cricket is a sport which is played between two teams of eleven players each who score runs (points). This is done by hitting the ball across the boundary,
or by running between two sets of three small, wooden posts called wickets. The wickets are at each end of a rectangle of short grass called 'the pitch'. 
The pitch is inside a much larger oval of grass called the 'area of play'. The area of play is a 30 yard circle inside the cricket ground or stadium. The game started in England in the 16th century. The earliest definite reference to the sport is in a court case of 1598. The court in Guildford heard 
a coroner, John Derrick, that when he was a scholar at the "Free School at Guildford", fifty years earlier, "he and diverse of his fellows did run and 
play [on the common land] at cricket and other players". Later, the game spread to countries of the British Empire in the 19th and 20th centuries.
